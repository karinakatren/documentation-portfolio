# Documentation Portfolio

## Overview

Hi there!

Almost all documentation that I have created has NDA restrictions, therefore it cannot be shared publicly.
However, I decided to create some examples of technical documentation that I have produced. The documents in this repository are completely anonymised.

These samples demonstrate my structure, clarity, troubleshooting methodology, onboarding design, and technical communication.

## Contents

- Troubleshooting Guide;
- Technical Onboarding Guide;
- Structured Bug Report Example.

Each document reflects real-world workflows I have worked with in IT operations and technical support environments.

## Approach to Documentation

 My documentation work usually consists of:

- A problem definition;
- Logical structure;
- Reproducible troubleshooting steps;
- Clearly defined escalation criteria;
- Terminology;
- Practical, user-oriented explanations.

Thank you!
